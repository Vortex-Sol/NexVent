      <h3 class="mb-4">Jet Fans</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        Jet fans are used in subway and highway tunnels, as well as in parking lot ventilation systems. The use of jet fans in parking lots can be more efficient and economical without the need to connect air ducts. Moreover, the omission of air ducts results in a loss of height in the parking lot ceiling. By installing the jet fans in a specific order and ensuring the draft distance, it is possible to deliver contaminated air to the vertical points of the shaft. Polluted air directed to the shafts is discharged from the ground using axial fans with circular discharge. These devices are also used as smoke exhaust fans

    <h3 class="mb-4">General Features of Jet Fans</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Jet fans are produced in two different versions: axial and radial. Electric motors used for ventilation and smoke removal are selected as two-speed motors. The device bodies are made of 2 mm thick galvanized sheet metal. There are circular mufflers on both sides of the propeller section. Electric motors can withstand temperatures of 300°C for 120 minutes. The propellers used are made of aluminum with an adjustable angle of inclination. Guides are used throughout the device to allow easy access to the group of fans and motors. On the air blowing side of the jet fans, special grooves are used that push the air over longer distances. Thanks to the guide vanes placed at the air outlet points, air is easily supplied to the desired point.

    <h3 class="mb-4">What is a Jet Fan Used For?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Jet fans perform the normal ventilation function and remove smoke at the same time. Where provided in parking lot ventilation systems operating according to a specific scenario, the ventilation also functions to remove smoke when desired. The jet fans, which operate under the control of air quality sensors and smoke detectors placed in parking lots, start operating in a first stage when indoor air quality deteriorates, and the fans are activated in a second stage when smoke is detected. Jet fans are powered by two-speed motors. The fact that land costs had reached high values in large cities made it necessary to build multi-story buildings. Jet fans are needed due to the fact that as many floors as possible are built at the height between the foundation and the roof specified by the building permitting authorities, forcing the height of the floors to be used as parking. In parking lots where ventilation is provided by jet fans, this allows air to be directed to specific sections without the need for an air duct.

    <h3 class="mb-4">Where Are Jet Fans Used?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Jet fans are used in subway and highway tunnels, as well as in parking lot ventilation systems. The use of jet fans in parking lots can be more efficient and economical without the need to connect air ducts. In addition, the withdrawal of air ducts causes height losses on the parking lot ceiling. By installing the jet fans in a specific order and ensuring the draft distance, it is possible to deliver contaminated air to the vertical points of the shaft. Polluted air directed to the shafts is discharged from the ground using axial fans with circular discharge. These devices are also used as smoke exhaust fans. In the event of a fire in any part of the parking lot, the equipment closest to that point operates at high speed and the smoke and flame are vented outside. This ensures that harmful exhaust gases accumulating in road and rail tunnels are directed along the ceiling and away from the tunnel exit point.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Jet fans mounted at intervals determined by the thrust force create an artificial air flow on the tunnel ceiling. They are also used to supply fresh air to galleries where work is carried out in mines and to remove harmful gases. They can be used in conjunction with an air duct or as a free discharge.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-4">Advantages of Jet Fan Systems</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Jet fan systems can operate without the need for air ducts or other air transfer installations. For large areas, the design is solved at a much more affordable cost than in the case of systems connected to air ducts. Ventilation systems with jet fans connected to automation systems can be easily operated from control centers.
