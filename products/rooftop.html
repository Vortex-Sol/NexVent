        Roof type air conditioners, also known as package type air conditioners, are devices used in multi-functional air conditioning systems. 
        These are units that simultaneously provide ventilation and air conditioning functions. Rooftop air conditioners, used in projects requiring fresh air supply and exhaust, 
        offer flexible solutions, allowing simultaneous operation in heating, cooling and ventilation modes.

    <h3 class="mb-4">What are the general features of roof type air conditioners?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Roof type air conditioners are compactly manufactured. The device housing structure is made of a durable steel system using special bending techniques. 
      The surface is covered with galvanized sheets with a thickness of 1.2 mm to 2.0 mm, which are also electrostatically painted. Roof type air conditioners are built on a durable frame. 
      The frame has mounting elements for attaching ropes and special sections for lifting with a forklift. Capacitor fans use external axial rotors. 
      Scroll compressors are used independently in two-, three- or four-loop cooling systems. Swivel condensers and evaporators are made of copper pipes and aluminum plates. 
      Directly driven plug fan amplifiers are used in fans and fans. Roof-type air conditioners use ecological gases R407c and R410a.
    </p>

  <div class="text element-animate">
    <h3 class="mb-4">What is the use of roof type air conditioner?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Rooftop air conditioners, also called package air conditioners, are used in multi-function air conditioning systems that provide both ventilation and air conditioning functions at the same time. 
      They are used in projects that require fresh air supply and air exhaust. Roof-type air conditioners enable simultaneous heating, cooling and ventilation functions, offering flexible solutions. 
      In cities where there are no architectural solutions enabling access to fresh air immediately after opening the window, buildings that are completely isolated from the surroundings require ventilation systems. 
      Roof-type air conditioners installed in the attic or mid-level technical rooms solve all these needs. There are many different options for the production of roof air conditioners. 
      With enthalpy control, fresh air can be supplied as needed, saving energy. Economizer models provide cooling as needed, ensuring comfortable conditions. 
      Thanks to the free cooling system, cold air from outside is directed directly inside, enabling cooling at very low costs. Models with heat recovery remove dirty air from the surroundings and supply the right amount of fresh air to the interior.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Rooftop type air conditioners vary depending on the climatic conditions in which they are used. In hot climate conditions, only cooling models are used. 
      In the middle zone, where there are four seasons, heat pump devices are used. In colder regions, devices with gas heating and batteries for heating water are used. 
      Due to the wide range of models, roof-type air conditioners can be used as air conditioning and ventilation equipment in all types of projects.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text element-animate">
    <h3 class="mb-4">What are the areas of application of roof-type air conditioners?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Roof type air conditioners are manufactured in various capacities from 9 to 300 kW and are used to air condition various spaces of different sizes. 
      They are especially preferred in the design of large shopping centers. They are used to ventilate independent sections and foyer spaces in shopping centers. 
      An adjustable air valve is left on the air duct to supply an equal amount of air to each independent section. They are used in cinemas and theaters to remove dirty air resulting from human density. 
      With one device that simultaneously performs the functions of fresh air supply, air exhaust, heating and cooling, you can create high air quality environments. 
      They enable economical and functional air conditioning in hospitals and large private and public buildings. Models with smaller capacity are used for air conditioning of apartments, offices and smaller spaces. 
      In roof-type air conditioners, airflow and pressure adjustments provide ease of use in designs with varying pressure losses. In devices with independent circuits, capacity can be controlled in four different steps: 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. 
      Capacity control is performed based on the average value of information from the return air and interior sensors.
    </p>

  <div class="text element-animate">
    <h3 class="mb-4">Are there any benefits to a rooftop air conditioner over other systems?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Rooftop type air conditioning systems are more beneficial than other systems because they contain all the features of air conditioning. 
      While alternative air conditioning systems perform heating, cooling and ventilation functions using separate units, roof-top air conditioners combine these functions in one unit. 
      For air conditioners and ventilation systems to work fully efficiently, it is necessary to control them using an automation system. However, roof type air conditioners are manufactured with internal automation systems. 
      Electronic control systems.
